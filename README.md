# RIVALZ-HACKATHON-MULTIAGENT
# Multi-Agent RAG System with TVL Monitoring

## Overview
This project demonstrates a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, enhanced with Total Value Locked (TVL) monitoring for various DeFi chains using the [DeFiLlama API](https://defillama.com/).

The system leverages multiple agents to handle tasks like:
- Fetching TVL data dynamically.
- Querying and monitoring DeFi protocols.
- Coordinating between agents in a multi-agent environment.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent System**: Uses multiple agents to handle specific tasks like TVL monitoring.
- **Real-Time TVL Fetching**: Fetches TVL data across multiple chains using the DeFiLlama API.
- **Real-Time Coin price Fetching**: Fetched coin prices accross multiple chains using coingecko API.
- **Real-Time Internet Search**: Search the internet in real time for information using duckduckgo API.
- **Customizable**: Agents can be tailored for specific DeFi protocols and workflows.
- **Error Handling**: Includes retries and logging for better fault tolerance.
- **API**: Used FASTAPI for building the backend API that handles requests and serves data.
